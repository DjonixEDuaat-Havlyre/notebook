Overview
</h1>

ZETA is an open environment for the development of specification
documents based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051224115606/http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/archive/z/">Z</a>. It provides an
integration framework for tools to edit, analyse and animate Z
specifications and formalisms which are mapped to Z.  It was developed
in course of the research project <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051224115606fw_/http://uebb.cs.tu-berlin.de:80/zeta/espress.html">ESPRESS</a>. A white paper about the conceptual
design can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051224115606/http://uebb.cs.tu-berlin.de/~wg/papers/zetawhite.ps.gz">here</a>.

<p>

A core edition of ZETA, version 1.5, which supports type-setting, type
checking and execution of pure Z (i.e. not the ESPRESS notation MSZ),
is now put in the public domain (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051224115606fw_/http://uebb.cs.tu-berlin.de:80/zeta/zetadistdoc/notes.html">release notes</a>). The functionality of
this release is as follows:

</p><ul type="disc" compact="">
<li>
contains the Z parser and type checker ESZ version 3 which (nearly) 
implements the Final Committee Draft of the Z Standard 

<!-- <li>
supports (or forthcomes to support) several markup languages and
Z lexes simultaneously 
--->

</li><li> integrates the TeX engine and provides a powerful Z-LaTeX style

</li><li> contains the ZAP <font color="red">version 2</font> tool for executing  
Z specifications, which is based on techniques of concurrent constraint 
resolution, and implements functional and logic computation features

</li><li> is written in Java and hence runs on many platforms
     (the execution engine is written in C++, but does not use
      OS dependend functionality)

</li><li> provides a Java-based abstract representation of Z for 
data-integration of tools, and
is easily extendable by Java-written plug-ins

</li><li> contains a comfortable Emacs-based GUI

</li><li> contains a Java-based GUI

</li><li> is under GPL

</li></ul>
